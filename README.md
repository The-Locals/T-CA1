Guidify is a travel guide application using recorded audio. A location can have multiple audio guides associated with it, and users can create guides for a location as well. We would use AI to filter through these submissions checking for key words in case of malicious intent. There will also be Itineraries available, these can be thought of as a playlist, it will be a collection of guides on locations in an area and the user can follow the trail from the itinerary at their own pace rather than be on a timed guide
